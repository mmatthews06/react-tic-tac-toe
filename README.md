# React Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a demo project, where a user can play Tic-Tac-Toe with a very clever Node.js server.

This project uses React 16.x and Node.js 8.x (LTS) at present. There are plans to add more front-end renderers besides SVG (like a Three.js board), and one or two more back-end players that are more AI-like and probabilistic in its moves.

**NOTE**: As of 7/15/2018, the back-end has barely been implemented.

### Installation
This set of steps currently only starts up the *dev* server, but it should suffice as a demo.
1. Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed
2. Clone this repository.
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mmatthews06/react-tic-tac-toe.git
 ```
3. Install Node modules:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 4. Run the API server:
  ```bash
  npm run start:api
  ```
 5. Run the front-end:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
 6. If a browser does not open up immediately, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
